# Wishart and Riesz distributions.

## Description
This project aims to create  *Python* and *R* packages for Wishart and Riesz distributions on general convex cones. This will include graphical Wishart and Riesz distributions. The Wishart distribution is a matrix-variate equivalent of the gamma distribution.
Wishart distributions are mainly used as stochastic volatility models.
Riesz distributions are multiparameter generalizations of
Wishart distributions. In the framework of statistical
graphical models, they provide scalable models for high dimensional data
analysis. 

The objectives are the following:

* Calculation of mean, covariance, correlation and probability density functions.
* Calculation of characteristic and gamma functions of the associated cones.
* Fitting Wishart and Riesz distributions
* Simulation of Wishart and Riesz distributions.


## Software requirements

* Python           : 3.7.4
* Numpy            : 1.16.5
